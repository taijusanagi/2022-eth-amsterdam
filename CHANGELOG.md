# Purpose

To make a log of ideas during this hackathon.

# 2022-Apr-23

- I attended a few sessions after the opening ceremony, and following protocols and SDKs are attractive to me

  - Connext
    - Cross-chain messaging bridge protocol
  - Tatum
    - Frontend SDK
  - Gnosis Safe
    - Multisig Wallet

- Current Product Idea

  - Use Connext and make a global NFT bridge add-on to any existing contract

- Issue solved by this project

  - NFT on L2 may have an L2 bridge to Ethereum but may not have interoperability between other chains. Using this product, NFT can have more interoperability
  - Use has more choice in how to bridge NFT between chains. Each option has a different level of security and useability

- Tomorrow to do
  - I make a basic working example of the NFT bridge and get feedback from the Connext team
  - I think I need to discuss more on the use case, so I talk with their business member
