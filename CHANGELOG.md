# Purpose

To make a log of ideas during this hackathon.

# 2022-Apr-23

- I attended a few sessions after the opening ceremony, and following protocols and SDKs are attractive to me

  - Connext
    - Cross-chain messaging bridge protocol
  - Tatum
    - Frontend SDK
  - Gnosis Safe
    - Multisig Wallet

- Current Product Idea

  - Use Connext and make a global NFT bridge add-on to any existing contract

- Issue solved by this project

  - NFT on L2 may have an L2 bridge to Ethereum but may not have interoperability between other chains. Using this product, NFT can have more interoperability
  - Use has more choice in how to bridge NFT between chains. Each option has a different level of security and useability

- Tomorrow to do
  - I make a basic working example of the NFT bridge and get feedback from the Connext team
  - I think I need to discuss more on the use case, so I talk with their business member

### What I implement

- NFT MARKET PLACE with Tarum
- It has the function of a bridge powered by Connext

### How I implement

- implement Connext beidge
- Implement marketplace
- Implement optimistic, Boba bridge

### Why I Implement

- NFT is everywhere! But most of them does not support bridge function natively
- If the user wants, the user can easily make NFT "omnichain"
- The bridge may have the security risk so user can choose which one user preffer
